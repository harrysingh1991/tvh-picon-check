1. Make sure git is installed

sudo apt-get install git

2. Create directory where picons will be accessed from and then download picons/picons repository from github 

cd [directory location]

git clone https://github.com/picons/picons.git

3. In TVHeadend set picons to be used over icons. Tick checkbox:

Configuration > General > Base > Prefer picons over channel icons

4. Reset icons path for all channels, if icon directory have previously been set up:

Configuration > Channel/EPG > Channels > highlight all channels, and click on Reset Icon

At this point make sure each channels icon location references each channes ServiceRef in the filename

5. Add tvheadend.serverconf and backgrounds.conf to Build-Input folder, in picons directory

see repository readme for example. Set 1 or two backgrounds in background.conf, otherwise it will take a while to run on Raspberry Pi

6. cd to picons directory and run:

./1-build-servicelist.sh

it will show enigma2 failure, just wait a few minutes, it's communicating with tvheadend.

7. check there is txt. output in the Build-Output folder. Inside it there will be a list of channels with matching icons. If yes, run the following command to create icons for matching channels:

./2-build-picons.sh

it will show enigma2 failure. Just wait a few minutes. it's communicating with tvheadend.

8. extract hardlink tarball and move data to tvheadend picons directory, as set in step 2

9. See exmaple Docker Compose and set up container.
